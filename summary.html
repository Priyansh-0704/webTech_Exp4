    <h2>SUMMARY:</h2>
    I am a BTech student specializing in Information and Communication Technology at Pandit Deendayal Energy University,with a strong academic record and a current CGPA of 8.8. My passion for game development and software engineering drives me to explore and implement innovative solutions in interactive entertainment and technology.
    <br>
    I have developed and published notable projects, including clones of popular games such as Flappy Bird and Hill Climb Racing using Unity, showcasing my ability to design engaging gameplay mechanics, and implement object-oriented programming principles. My proficiency extends across multiple programming languages, including C#, C, C++, and SQL, enabling me to develop robust and scalable applications.
    <br>
    My technical skillset encompasses game engines like Unity and Godot, alongside essential developer tools that support my workflow, such as version control systems (Git), database management, and UI/UX design tools. Additionally, I have earned certifications in foundational C# (Microsoft & freeCodeCamp) and Unity Game Development (Udemy), further solidifying my expertise in game programming and software development.
    <br>
    I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge in real-world projects through internships or job roles that align with my interests in gameplay programming, and software development. With a keen eye for problem-solving and a commitment to continuous learning.
